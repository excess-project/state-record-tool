Linux command line utility to read system state at a fixed rate.

INSTALL
-------

Selection of performance counters are a compile time decision which
additionally may require a machine specific configuration.
Select counters and machine configuration by defining the appropriate macros
during compilation.

Compiling the PAPI back-ends:

1. Set PAPIDIR to the PAPI installation directory.

Compiling the likwid back-end:

1. Set LIKWIDDIR to the likwid installation directory.
   Set LIKWIDSRC to the likwid source distribution directory.

2. NOTE: In this case the binary falls under GPLv3 due to linking with likwid and thus,
   in this case, all used state-record-tool sources must and can be distributed as GPLv3.

Compiling:

% ./COMPILE.sh -D<machine macro>

Available back-end macros:
  PAPI_CORETEMP
  PAPI_RAPL (binary has to be setuid root and have setcap cap_sys_rawio=ep set.)
  LIKWID_RAPL (the likwid msr daemon must be installed and set up.)
